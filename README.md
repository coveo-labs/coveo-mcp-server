# Coveo MCP Server

> **Disclaimer**  
The Coveo MCP Server is provided as-is, intended purely for educational and exploratory purposes. Itâ€™s not a production-ready product.

## Overview
This is a simple MCP server that connects to **Coveo** and executes search queries. It provides tools for:

- Search functionality
- Passage retrieval
- Question answering

## Available Tools

### search_coveo
Queries the Coveo API and retrieves search results.
```
Input: query (string) - The search query text
Input: numberOfResults (int, optional) - The number of documents to retrieve from the index. Default: 5.
Output: Formatted search results or error message
```

### passage_retrieval
Retrieves specific passages from documents that are relevant to a query.
```
Input: query (string) - The search query text
Output: Formatted passages or error message
```

### answer_question
Answer questions using Coveo Relevance Generative Answering.
```
Input: query (string) - The question to answer
Output: Generated answer from Coveo sources with citations
```

## Features
- Asynchronous API requests using httpx
- Proper error handling
- Formatted responses for better readability
- Environment variable configuration
- Semantic passage retrieval for more precise information extraction

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coveo-labs/coveo-mcp-server.git
   cd coveo-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Create and populate the .env file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Coveo credentials
   ```

3. **Required Environment Variables**
   ```
   COVEO_API_KEY - Your Coveo API key
   COVEO_ORGANIZATION_ID - Your Coveo Organization ID
   COVEO_ANSWER_CONFIG_ID - Your Coveo Answer Config ID for the generative answering feature
   ```

## Testing with MCP Inspector
You can test the server with the MCP Inspector in two ways:

1. Using the `mcp dev` command:
```bash
mcp dev src/coveo_mcp_server/__main__.py
```
This will start the MCP Inspector at http://localhost:5173, where you can interact with and test the server's functionality.

2. Using `npx` with the MCP Inspector:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  uv \
  --directory /[path to project]/coveo-mcp-server \
  run \
  --with mcp \
  mcp run src/coveo_mcp_server/__main__.py
```

## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. You can install the latest version here. If you already have Claude for Desktop, make sure it's updated to the latest version.

We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.

Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "coveo_mcp_server": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/coveo-mcp-server/src/coveo_mcp_server",
                "run",
                "__main__.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Note: If Claude for Desktop cannot find the `uv` command, you may need to specify the full path in the configuration:
```json
"command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uv"
```

## Testing
This project includes comprehensive unit tests for all API functions and MCP tools.

### Running Tests
To run the tests and generate a coverage report:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./run_tests.sh

# Or using pytest directly
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/coveo_mcp_server
```

### Test Coverage
The tests cover:
- All Coveo API client functions
- Error handling and edge cases
- MCP server tools integration
- Response formatting

### Adding New Tests
When adding new functionality, please follow the Test-Driven Development approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement the minimum code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
